4_slots.csp
51_2_4_slots.csp
51_2_4_slots.dats

File 4_slots.csp contains the model for the four-slots protocol, which was written manually. 51_2_4_slots.csp contains the model generated from 51_2_4_slots.dats. Now we can use these two files to compare the efficiency of checking these two models. This shall help locate some of the causes leading to the inefficiency of generated model. E.g. invocation of pure function, verbose thread initialization, and etc.

Please refer to google doc "ATS model checker experiment" for results.
